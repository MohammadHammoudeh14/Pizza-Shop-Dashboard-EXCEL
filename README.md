# Pizza Shop Sales Dashboard (Excel)

Below is a screenshot of the interactive dashboard created in this project.

This project presents an interactive sales dashboard for a pizza shop, built using Microsoft Excel to support data-driven decision-making for business stakeholders.

The dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs), including total sales, total orders, total quantity sold, and average order value. It helps stakeholders quickly assess overall business performance without relying on manual analysis of raw data.

By highlighting the top and bottom 5 pizzas, the dashboard identifies best- and worst-performing products, enabling better menu optimization decisions. Revenue distribution is visualized through **pie charts** by pizza category and size, offering insights into customer preferences and product mix.

Sales trends are analyzed over time using a **line chart** for monthly sales, while a **bar chart** shows sales performance by hour of the day. Interactive filters for category, size, and month allow users to explore the data dynamically and answer specific business questions with ease.
